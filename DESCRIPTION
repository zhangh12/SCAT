Description: Conditional association test based on summary data from genome-wide association study (GWAS). SCAT adjusts for heterogeneity in SNP coverage that exists in meta-analysis summary data if SNPs are not present in all of the participating studies. This commonly happens when imputations are done on different reference panels in participating studies. This could happen when ones simply do not have data for some SNPs. Without properly adjusting for this kind of heterogeneity leads to inflated false positive rate. SCAT can also be used for conditional association analysis when heterogeneity is absent. For more details, refer to Zhang et al. (2018) Brief Bioinform. 19(6):1337-1343. doi: 10.1093/bib/bbx072.
