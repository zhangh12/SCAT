This R package is used for conducting conditional association test based on summary data from genome-wide association study (GWAS) adjusting for heterogeneity in SNP coverage. Without properly adjustment of coverage heterogeneity would lead to highly inflated p-values of conditional test. More details could be found in Zhang *et al.* (2017) Briefings in Bioinformatics.
